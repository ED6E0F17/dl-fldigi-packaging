The scripts will create a temporary directory using mktemp, inside /tmp,
download all the stuff and compile it. Despite placing a symlink to this
folder in the working directory, they will not delete this folder
afterwards; it typically has a name like /tmp/dl-fldigi.XXXXXX and you
should rm -Rf it.

On my box this builds a binary successfully and places it in
$PREFIX/bin.
I have no clue if this binary actually runs/works on a win32 box.
